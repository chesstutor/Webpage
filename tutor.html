					<h1> Meet the Tutors </h1>
					<h3>Grigor Cruz</h3>
					<img src="img/profilepic1.jpg"/> 
						<p>A Hungarian born student, who studies Philosophy at the University of Szeged. Grigor has had an in interest in chess since childhood competing in competitions since the age of 8. A lead competitor in the Hungarian chess scene and rising world talent 
						   Grigor has wanted to take his love for chess and help teach new talent. He believe chess is the game of kings and shows the true workings of a person’s brain and their philosophy on life. This drives him to want to see as many people play chess as possible 
						so he can complete his study on how people approach the game according to their philosophies.</p>
						
					<h3>Jakeson Bramberly</h3>
					<img src="img/profilepic2.jpg"/> 
						<p>A primary school teacher from Winchester with a passion for chess. Jakeson or JS for short has been teaching children chess for years and has a great understanding for the game. He has key knowledge on how to raise new talent and many of his pupils have 
						went on to win tournaments and represent themselves very well on the national stage. We sought Bramberly out as we want to make sure at Chess Tutor we have Tutors for plays of all ablates. </p>
					
					<h3>Wang Yi</h3>
					<img src="img/profilepic3.jpg"/> 
						<p>Wang, born in China as a daughter to rich business owner, she moved to England to study history at Cambridge Universtiy. Before moving to England she competed in many chess tournaments in China and was a local champion. After graduating with a first class degree 
						Wang went into teaching and ran a chess club at the school she joined. She now joins Chess tutor to help pass on her love for the game to an even wider audience. </p>
					
					<h3>Sergey Deshun</h3>
					<img src="img/profilepic4.png"/> 
						<p>The resident Russian chess master and the first tutor that joined the Chess Tutor group. Sergey works for a law firm in Moscow, but in his spare time plays chess online and has been known in Russia for his online tutor classes. He was a perfect choice for our 
						business as he has experience with all different levels of chess player and Russia has many of their rising talents due to his tutorage. Sergey himself is a chess champion within Russia but has yet to make a huge impact on the world stage. Nevertheless the perfect 
						man for Chess Tutor</p>
						
					<h3>Magners Carlsberg</h3>
					<img src="img/profilepic5.jpg"/> 
						<p>A relatively new chess player, Magners only discovered the game a few years back when people at his bar started playing a game. Since then he has been deeply interested in chess and has learnt very quickly how to play the game at its highest level. Magners now 
						wants to see high level chess players play the game and study their patterns, so has come to Chess Tutor to advise and comment on the best players on the internet. Chess tutor is not just for new players and with the help of Tutors like Magners there will be advise 
						dedicated to the high level players on the site.  </p>
						
					<h3>Sebastian Crowler</h3>
					<img src="img/profilepic6.jpg"/> 
						<p>Graduated from Yale at the age of 15, Sebastian is our sites wonder child. Since the age of 4 Seb has been playing chess and beating all of the adults around him. This kind of raw talent is hard to come by and he brings a unique perspective on the game. With Sebastian’s 
						enthusiasm to find ways of beating the best chess players he passes on his unique advice to the chess tutor users to improve their game and to test new innovative strategies towards the game of chess. </p>
					
					<h3>Lucy Thompson</h3>
					<img src="img/profilepic7.png"/> 
						<p>A recent Statistics graduate from the University of Lincoln, Lucy plays chess in her spare time and has a deep love for the game. Lucy isn’t a competition player but her caring approach to students has shown she is very good at nurturing new talent. The basics are the 
						fundamentals of chess and some tutors expect people to know them before they watch, but Lucy expects players to have never seen the game and is great at giving advice to those of little prior skill. At Chess tutor we want any level of player to be able to get great advice 
						and with Lucy on the team we can support the brand new players accordingly. </p>
						
					<h3>Pat Smith</h3>
					<img src="img/profilepic8.jpg"/> 
						<p>Retired Marine biologist and Chess lover. Since her tragic accident with a Walrus and an Orca she was left without legs so now plays chess in her spare time to relax, and block out the horrific memories of her tragic fight for survival. Her attitude as a fighter has made 
						her a formidable chess player, who has a high level of knowledge of the game that she loves to pass on to all levels of player. We found Pat down of her look at the local gentlemen’s club, teaching her patron’s chess as she seduced them into giving her money. We wanted to 
						save Pat from this life of being a legless chess playing striper, and help her attend her local drugs anonymous advice group. </p>
