					<h3>Who are we</h3>
						<p>ChessTutor comprises of 7 Computer-Oritneted students at the University of Lincoln, a percentage of us study Computer Science, while others study Computer Information Systems as well as Games Computing. We are all Chess enthusiasts and enjoy playing Chess. </p>
					<h3>History</h3>
						<p>In 2015, we had the idea of having a person being able to teach and guide Chess players through their games when several new-comers needed assistance in their game of Chess. Chess Tutor came alive in early 2016 and the amount of users rapidly increased with over 3,000 player in the first month!</p>
					<h3>Our Goal</h3>
						<p>At Chess Tutor, we like to help people - so as a community we would like to grow Chess tutor towards people that cannot play Chess. Our user-based chat system has proven very helpful to users because instead of going in blind, people can learn and play chess with help.</p><q>I've never been much of a computer guy at least in terms of playing with computers. Actually until I was about 11 I didn't use a computer for preparing for games at all. I was playing a bit online, was using the chess club mainly. Now, obviously, the computer is an important tool for me preparing for my games.</q><p id="nameQuote">Magnus Carlsen - World Champion</p>
